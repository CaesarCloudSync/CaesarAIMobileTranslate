Tell you basically what what this is about is when i was watching harvey mackay at one of harvick's things he said he just finished the boston marathon and you know the guy is 76 and i went holy crap you know this is amazing he looked so fit and he he's so quick minded and and so on i thought all the sudden it occurred to me i bet the way you eat you know is different i bet you don't just just eat a bunch of garbage. 
And that started this thought so the the basic request is will be and i'm recording it for use as well if if i transcribed these for the book but then i write about it and what's really been neat about it is that what started out as three same questions to everybody everybody had kind of a different angle on it and i realized that they were creating the chapters for this book and of course marcy shy. 
Fred me the right exit i'm not doing something where where i did all the work and you're just transcribing it but if you actually write in the book i'll do it so i made her that promise and it was a hard promise but it was a good one to make because it made me think more you know so what i would do is i basically introduce you and then you can add anything that you think is important to that introduction and. 
Let me get my history up here because i have i have you on here so how's robbie doing yeah did you guys have a nice holiday. 
Okay so i'm going to is your best website we're going to at the end i'm going to ask you know about your website and stuff is rick richmond.com the best one to go to or probably the best you had a really good bio on one of your website. 
Check that out and okay so that we go about rick yeah so you know one of the things that that i'll bring up is you know you always talk about how you have the biggest rolodex i thought that was a really cool angle too because part of part of success is who you know and i. 
You know i think that's important i don't know what your what your angle is going to be on this but you know the questions will be do you think that that hypothesis is true that you know food affects your ability to succeed on some level and then if you know if it if it plays into your level of success in other words their successful people who eat crappy food but so far.
